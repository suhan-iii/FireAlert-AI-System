## ðŸ“Œ Pin Connections

| Component            | Pin on Sensor | ESP32 Pin | Notes |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| *MQ-2*             | VCC          | 3.3V      | Use 3.3V for ESP32 compatibility |
|                      | GND          | GND       |       |
|                      | A0           | GPIO 34   | Analog input |
| *DHT22*            | VCC          | 3.3V      |       |
|                      | GND          | GND       |       |
|                      | Data         | GPIO 4    | Requires pull-up resistor (10kÎ©) |
| *IR Sensor* (opt)| VCC          | 3.3V      |       |
|                      | GND          | GND       |       |
|                      | OUT          | GPIO 27   | Digital input |
| *Buzzer*           | +            | GPIO 25   | PWM-capable pin recommended |
|                      | -            | GND       |       |

## âš™ Power Considerations
- The ESP32â€™s *3.3V pin* can power the sensors.
- If adding more components, use an *external power supply* (regulated 3.3V) to avoid instability.
- Avoid powering the MQ-2 from 5V when connected to ESP32 analog pins.

---

## ðŸ”Œ Steps to Assemble
1. Place ESP32 on a breadboard.
2. Connect each sensor according to the table above.
3. Double-check VCC and GND connections â€” wrong polarity can damage components.
4. Connect the buzzerâ€™s + pin to GPIO 25, - pin to GND.
5. Plug ESP32 into your computer via USB.
6. Upload the Arduino .ino file from the hardware/ folder.

## âœ… Testing Hardware
1. Use individual sensor test scripts before full integration.
2. Open Arduino Serial Monitor at *115200 baud*.
3. Verify each sensor outputs expected values before running the AI model.

## ðŸ“œ Notes
- Keep wires short to reduce interference.
- MQ-2 sensors require *pre-heating* (about 1â€“2 minutes) before stable readings.
- If using IR sensor, adjust the potentiometer for detection sensitivity.
